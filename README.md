### Downloading a precompiled version
If you just want to get the program running, head over to the [releases tab](https://github.com/Joelbu537/C-Text-Adventure/releases) and **download the newest release**.\
Make sure to choose the right operating system!\
I don't update the released versions with each commit, so building from source might give you access to features you wouldn't get otherwise.
### Building from source code
If you want to make sure that you get what you see, you can simply **clone the repository and build it yourself**.\
Use `dotnet build --configuration Release` to build.
> [!NOTE]
> You need to have .NET 10 installed to build this project.
