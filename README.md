  <span>Installation</span>
</h2>

### Downloading a precompiled version
If you just want to get the program running, head over to the [releases tab](https://github.com/Joelbu537/C-Text-Adventure/releases) and **download the newest release**.\
Make sure to choose the right operating system!\
Extract the files from the .zip and launch the executable.\
I don't update the released versions with each commit, so building from source might give you access to features you wouldn't get otherwise.
### Building from source code
If you want to make sure that you get what you see, you can simply **clone the repository and build it yourself**.\
Use `dotnet build --configuration Release` to build.
> [!NOTE]
> You need to have **.NET 10** installed to build this project.

  <span>Gameplay</span>
</h2>

Creating a good story for the game is not my top priority, instead, I want to focus on the functionality. So be aware of that.\
Playing the game is pretty simple. Just write what you want to do. Like `go north` or `take note`.\
To get a better understanding of the commands, you can always go to the help page by typing `help`, where all commands, parameters and variations are listed.
